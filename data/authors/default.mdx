I grew up in Kolkata and enjoyed solving math problems in middle school.
When I arrived at ISI, I found the pure math curriculum to be too abstract for my liking.
I was always captivated by the idea of using math to understand and quantify real-word problems - and I found that in statistics.

The ideas of separating signal from noise and reasoning under uncertainty really appealed to me.
At the same time, my undergraduate training instilled in me the importance of rigorously justifying the models we use and assessing their strengths and weaknesses.

At ETH Zürich, I studied a broader range of statistical models and the theory behind them.
I am currently interested in statistical inference and non parametric models.
During my time at the [Robinson Statistical Bioinformatics Group](https://robinsonlabuzh.github.io), I developed an interest in bioinformatics and am generally interested in the kind of models used to study omics data.

I also enjoy listening to music.
