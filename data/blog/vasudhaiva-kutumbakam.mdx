> अयं निजः परो वेति गणना लघुचेतसाम्। <br/>
> उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्॥

<AuthorNote>- Upanishad</AuthorNote>

which, according to Wikipedia, literally translates to

> One Is A Relative, The Other Stranger,<br />
> Say The Small Minded.<br />
> The Entire World Is A Family,<br />
> Live The Magnanimous.

<AuthorNote>[- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudhaiva_Kutumbakam)</AuthorNote>

I find this quote to be really beautiful, but I feel that the translation doesn't fully
capture its depth, which is why I wanted to share my own perspective. The translation makes
it sound like a prescription for wisdom &mdash; as though declaring the world your family
and hugging everyone will somehow lead to englightenment.

To me, <i>Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam</i> is more of a cautionary tale against adopting rigid{' '}

<q>for/against</q> stances. Historically, nothing good has ever come out of a
<q>with-me-against-me</q> mentality, and this seems even more relevant in today's socio-political
setup. Time and time again, compromise has been the foundation of peaceful coexistence.

So, to me, the essence of <i>Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam</i> is not about hugging everyone we
meet. It is about recognizing the complexity within us all &mdash; understanding that there
is both good and bad in every individual, and that we're all trying our best. It's about
acknowledging that there is always another perspective to be considered and that it deserves
just as much respect as our own.
